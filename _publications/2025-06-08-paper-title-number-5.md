**Abstract:**  
Measurement-based Quantum Computation (MBQC) utilizes entanglement as a resource for performing quantum computation. Generating cluster states using entanglement is a key bottleneck for the adoption of MBQC. To generate cluster states with charge-qubit arrays, we provide analytical derivations and numerical validations for a 4-qubit cluster state. We compare fidelities under ideal (noise-free) Hamiltonian evolution and under decoherence effects. Incorporating energy relaxation yields ~90% fidelity, while pure dephasing shows decays at fourth harmonics. Under noise, fidelity decays to 50% within 15 time units, versus 70% under relaxation-only time units. This decay quantifies the degradation effect on cluster-state preparation. We highlight the critical need for targeted error-mitigation strategies in near-term MBQC implementations.
